				<div id="About" class="tab-pane fade in active">
					<p>I am currently a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Sciences majoring in Networked and Social Systems Engineering. Outside my studies, I work as a teaching assistant for the Introductory Computer Science course at Penn (CIS 110). I am also an active member of the Science and Technology residential program, serve as the Outreach Chair for the community service organization CommuniTech, play intramural sports, and participate in PennApps, Penn's premier hackthon, every semester. My interests lie in the field of network theory, artificial intelligence, and real-world markets. To sum up, I enjoy partaking in the challenges involved in solving problems that regularly arise in computer science.</p>
